# Fire Fighting Robot

## Overview
The Fire Fighting Robot is an autonomous system designed to detect, approach, and extinguish fires in hazardous environments. This project aims to reduce risks to human firefighters and improve efficiency in fire suppression by leveraging robotics and automation.

## Features
- Fire Detection: Equipped with flame sensors, infrared cameras, and temperature sensors to accurately locate fire sources.
- Navigation: Uses wheels or tracks with obstacle-avoidance capabilities to maneuver through rough terrains.
- Fire Suppression: Incorporates water jets or fire extinguishers to combat flames effectively.
- Remote and Autonomous Operation: Supports manual control via a remote interface and autonomous functioning through artificial intelligence.

## Components
1. Microcontroller: Arduino for controlling the robot.
2. Sensors:
   - Flame sensors
   - Temperature sensors
3. Mobility:
   - DC motors with motor drivers
   - Wheels or tracks for movement
4. Fire Suppression System:
   - Water pump or fire extinguisher module
5. Power Supply:  direct power using lithium ion battries.

## How It Works
1. The robot scans the environment for fire or high-temperature zones using its sensors.
2. Once fire is detected, it calculates the optimal path to approach the fire while avoiding obstacles.
3. The suppression system activates to extinguish the fire.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming and robotics.
- Required software: Arduino IDE
